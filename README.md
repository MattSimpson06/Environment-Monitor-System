Overview

This project is a real-time indoor environment monitoring application developed as a bonus project for EECS 1021. It integrates an Arduino-based sensor system with a JavaFX desktop application to display indoor environmental data and compare it with live outdoor weather information retrieved from the OpenWeather API.
The system focuses on monitoring temperature, humidity, and pressure, presenting the data through a graphical interface with real-time charts and summary panels.
